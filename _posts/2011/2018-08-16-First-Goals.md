title: Introducing Jekyll Bootstrap
layout: default

---

Jekyll bootstrap is a theme for jekyll which uses the [twitter bootstrap css framework](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).
The advantage of jekyll is that it is self hosted (or hosted on github) and that you can write in markdown on a text editor and just git push new posts to a server which produces html files. The advantage of this theme is so that you can start blogging almost right away without having to worry about making a theme.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up
To start you own blog, simply `git clone` the [repository on github](https://github.com/nhoss2/jekyll-bootstrap). You could also press the "fork" button on github.

	git clone git://github.com/nhoss2/jekyll-bootstrap.git

If you want to have your blog on github, make sure you change to the `gh-pages` branch.
